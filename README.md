The GifTastic app pulls the top 10 gifs of the specified search term from GIPHY using an AJAX GET.

This particular app specifies a set number of dog breeds and dynamically creates the dog breeds in click buttons in the page. The user can click a button and 10 gifs will appear below the buttons showing the still image of a gif from the GIPHY API. The user can click each individual gif image to start the gif and click it again to stop the gif. Clicking a new button clears the currently selected gifs from the page and populates the page with more gifs. 

The user also has the option of adding their own button. The app has a user input box on the right hand side of the page that collects user input upon click and pressing enter. If the dog breed is already displayed as a button, then a message appears telling the user to enter another dog breed.
